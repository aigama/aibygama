1.so I was cold
emailing a founder
whose startup is valued at $5 billion
and he didn't take more than 15 minutes to reply
as you can see like the 10 emails we exchanged
we even closed the deal in two days
and this is honestly
not the first time I've seen this happen
so I've come to the conclusion that the busiest people

2.he is Aman
 he's giving me a shout out
but why
cause I had him
grow from 20,000 followers to more than
200,000 followers now
but am I just an editor
maybe or maybe not cause I graduated from SRCC
but why am I telling you all this
cause I want validation not sure
or I want to show that my life is more happening than yours
nah
but one thing that I really want to
is to reach out to the most talented
and creative people out there because we are hiring

3. calling all CS students
  still got to make that portfolio project right
Bet.

4. you see a few years ago I was the biggest fan of Okas
now he's nothing less than a brother to me
the past 6 months have shown me glimpses of a dream
I've had from a very long time
I went from being a loser
chasing clout to building
one of the fastest growing infotainment channels in the country

5.this is Braden
and he only has 47 days and four hours to save his app
and time is ticking
so Braden is building an app that helps you learn
how to play chess by having an AI assistant
he's been building it for four months and so far Braden
the app is 100% there yet but in order to improve on it
Braden actually needs people to test it out
any ideas for how Braden gets this app to more people
let me know in the comments

6. we got our client of 1 million views in that first reel
at just 300 followers
this is the same founder to whom I said
even if I get to 1,000 followers
which by the way is the hardest special to crack
but the one thing I did promise him was really good input
the best that he can possibly get in terms of writing, editing, creative ,direction
 you name it we do that consistently for long enough
it's just hard for your content to not blow up
sooner or later or like in this case
in the very first reel 


7. fuck your fancy words
I've been making $5,000
consistently in this 10K challenge
as a college student because of it
if you want your content to convert
it needs to be understood first
I write all my scripts in a few minutes on my phone
speak away and still manage to get thousands of views
so what's important to reach more people
it's simpler words which means more comprehension
Which means making it easier for someone to get hooked to your content
Now what's the easiest way to get that
Use the first way a line comes in your head
you know and the way you actually talk to yourself
and your friends and write your script
using exactly those without much editing

8. at 25 I took my best career decision
By joining an early stage startupfunnyly enough I was the only designer on the team
and I didn't know how to use figma
but within 10 months of that
I designed an entire size dashboard from scratch
I redesigned the entire website
and executed it from backdrop
and I designed quite a few pitch techs
serious techs and marketing material
and I went from earning 40 k
a month to 1.2 likes per month
in a matter of 10 months
but most importantly
since I spend my time with founders
I worked the hardest I ever had
and I pushed myself like I never did before
being the only designer in the leading team
I learn to be resourceful
spending time with a small team
gave me entitled to product
tech and business
and founders usually have great connect
and feel good at what you do
and have a good attitude
they will happily introduce you today
so naturally whenever anybody comes to me for advice
I always tell them to join an early state startup
even if it means less money and less security
because you won't get to learn that fast
and you won't grow so rapidly anywhere

9.this is abel and he just built an AI study buddy
that's going to help you learn any subject
10xfaster
let's just say you have a philosophy exam coming up in
like the next 48 hours
you literally just grab the PDF version of the b
ook you're studying upload it onto the app
it gives you options like summaries
quizzes and classcards and it also helps you with SATs
MCASS ACTs and even a DMV test
so if you got an exam to study for
and you're running out of time
it might be worth trying out Able's app so check the caption for the link to app

10. two billion dollars yeah
that's the fund size of the VC's that chose to mentor me for four months
and they gave me a hundred thousand dollar grant
just to go and build my dream
and you probably don't believe me
it's okay I didn't believe it either
when they first offered it to me
and while so many people watching my 30 grow challenge
thought it was too big
they asked me why my dreams was so small
and for someone who barely attended college
let alone got an MBA before Fix Michaels
this Spark Fellowship literally changed my life
and the way I run my business
I mean can you even imagine putting a price tag on
getting to learn from some legends in the industry
Can you?
Well you can't 
because it really is priceless

11.if you're not employed by anyone
and you do something of your own
it's one of the toughest things you can do
in your career you don't escape the 9 to 5
save yourself for 24 7 I mean
virtually there are no negatives
it's just not for everybody
you'll see the bright side of it
having enough cash flow
and your business is running well
and you can take days off and things won't change
and you take permission from no one
that's where you understand the good side of this game
don't think that you'll build something
and then just fuck off you'll always come back to it
because of your love for the game
